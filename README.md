# Inference-in-First-Order-Logic

 In this project, we want to help users to find out what an enterprise can do with their data before giving permission to their applications to access that.
We are going to implement a backward chaining system that gets the rules of data-mining and the abilities that an enterprise has at its disposal. Then it will help customers to find out if a certain type of personal information can be extracted by that enterprise if it gains access to another set of information about the user.
